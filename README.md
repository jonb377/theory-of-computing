A repo for my implementation of topics covered in CS-7133 Theory of Computing course.

## Regular Languages
I have implemented the following for regular languages:
- Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Finite Acceptors
- Deterministic Finite Acceptor state minimization algorithm
- NFA to DFA conversion algorithm
- Regular Expressions using recursive definition and NFA construction
- Regular Expressions parser
- Left and Right Linear Grammars
- Right Linear Grammar to NFA conversion
